## What is Spotify Open Recommendation Engine?
Have you used Spotify's Song Radio feature? Or Discover Weekly?

This is that, but better.

**Spotify Open Recommendation Engine** is a web app that allows you to use Spotify's built in recommendations service to create a playlist customized to your taste. 
We give users full control over the sonic characteristics persisted in each track's metadata to request really, really specific song recommendations. Plus, it won't judge you :).
